        <h1>Disadvantages</h1>
    <pre>
<h2>1-High cost</h2>
It’s true that AI comes with a high cost, but there is no such thing as a free lunch too. It requires huge costs as 
it is a complex machine. Apart from the installation cost, its repair and maintenance also require huge costs. The 
software programs need frequent upgradation and cater to the needs of the changing environment.
Also, if there is a breakdown, the cost of procurement is very high. With that, recovery requires huge time too.

<h2>2-No human replication</h2>
No matter how smart a machine becomes, it can never replicate a human. Machines are rational but, very inhuman as 
they don’t possess emotions and moral values. They don’t know what is ethical and what’s legal and because of this, 
don’t have their own judgment making skills. They do what they are told to do and therefore the judgment of right or 
wrong is nil for them. If they encounter a situation that is unfamiliar to them then they perform incorrectly or else 
break down in such situations.
        
<h2>3-No improvement with Experience</h2>
Artificial intelligence cannot be improved with experience, they can perform the same function again if no different 
command is given to them. With time, it can lead to wear and tear. It stores a lot of data but the way it can be 
accessed and used is very different from human intelligence.
Also, they can’t cope up with the dynamic environment and so they are unable to alter their responses to changing 
environments. We are constantly bombarded by the question of whether it is really exciting to replace humans with 
machines.
Artificial intelligence doesn’t have feelings and because of which there is nothing like working with a whole heart 
or with full passion for them. There is no sense of belonging or togetherness or a human touch. They fail to 
distinguish between a hardworking individual and an inefficient individual.
        
<h2>4-Creativity is not the key for AI</h2>
Machines can’t be creative. They can only do what they are being taught or commanded. Though they help in designing 
and creating, they can’t match the power of a human brain.
Humans are sensitive and intellectuals and they are very creative too. They can generate ideas, can think out of the 
box. They see, hear, think and feel which machine can’t. Their thoughts are guided by the feelings which completely 
lacks in machines. No matter how much a machine outgrows, it can’t inherent intuitive abilities of the human brain 
and can’t replicate it.        

<h2>5-Unemployment</h2>
This one is the riskiest and can have severe effects. With capital intensive technologies, human-intensive 
requirements have decreased in some industries. If in the future, human beings don’t add to their skills, then in no 
time, we can see that they will be replaced with machines. The major issue of the GDP being stagnant or not growing 
at the expected rate is unemployment. People don’t possess the required skills that are in demand. There is a huge 
demand and supply gap because of this. </pre>
