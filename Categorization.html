    <Pre><h3>
Artificial intelligence can be divided into two different categories: weak and strong.

<p style="color:red;">Weak artificial intelligence.</p> embodies a system designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games 
such as the chess example from above and personal assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Apple's Siri. You ask the assistant 
a question, it answers it for you.

<p style="color:red;">strong artificial intelligence.</p> are systems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. 
These tend to be more complex and complicated systems. They are programmed to handle situations in which they may be 
required to problem solve without having a person intervene. These kinds of systems can be found in applications 
like self-driving cars or in hospital operating rooms.</h3></Pre>
