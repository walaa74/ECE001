<h1>Advantages</h1>

    <Pre>
<h1>1-AI doesn’t get tired and wear out easily</h1>
<h3>Artificial Intelligence and the science of robotics is used in mining and other fuel exploration processes. These 
complex 
machines help to explore the ocean floor and overcome human limitations. Due to the programming of the robots, they 
can perform a more laborious task with extra hard work and with greater responsibility. Moreover, they do not wear out 
        easily.</h3>
        
<h1>3-Digital assistance helps in day to day chores</h1>
<h3>Siri listens to us and performs the task in one tap. GPS helps you to travel the world. How can I forget the basic 
necessity? 
Food, clothing, shelter, and smartphone. They are the ones that predict what we are going to type, in short, they 
know us better than anyone. The best is the autocorrect feature, it understands what you are trying to say and 
present you the sentence in the best way possible. Have you observed that while you post a picture on social media, 
you tag people, but the machine automatically detects the person’s face and tags that individuals? Same is when you 
work on Google Photos. Automatically, a folder is created of the people with the help of their faces. Artificial 
Intelligence is widely employed by financial institutions and banking institutions because it helps to organize and 
manage data. Also, detection of fraud uses artificial intelligence in a smart card-based system.</h3>
        
<h1>4-Rational decision maker</h1>
<h3>Logic above all! Highly advanced organizations have digital assistants which help them to interact with the users and 
save 
the need for human resources.
Right program decisions can be taken if they are worked upon rationally. But, with humans, emotions come along. When 
artificial thinkers, there is no distraction at all. They don’t have an emotional side, and that makes robots think 
logically. Emotions are not associated with them and therefore the mood doesn’t hamper the efficiency. Thus they are always 
productive.</h3>

<h1>5-Repetitive jobs</h1>
<h3>The same old task, a task that doesn’t add value is of no use. Also, repetitive jobs are monotonous in nature and can be 
carried out with the help of machine intelligence. Machines think faster than humans and can perform various functions at 
the same time. It can be employed to carry out dangerous tasks and its parameters are adjusted. This is not possible with 
humans as their speed and time can’t be calculated on the basis of parameters.</h3>

<h1>6-Medical applications</h1>
<h3>This is the best thing that artificial intelligence has done to humans. It’s said that time and tide waits for none but, 
with medical applications of artificial intelligence, a wide scope application is present. Doctors assess patients 
and their health risks with the help of artificial machine intelligence. The applications help to educate the 
machine about the side effects of various medicines. Nowadays, medical professionals are trained with artificial 
surgery simulators. It uses application which helps in detecting and monitoring neurological disorders and stimulate 
the brain functions. This also helps in the radiosurgery. Radiosurgery is used in operating tumors and help in the 
operation without damaging the surrounding tissues.</h3>

<h1>7-Tireless, selfless and with no breaks</h1>
<h3>A machine doesn’t require breaks like the way humans do. They are programmed for long hours and can continuously perform 
without getting bored or distracted. The machine does not get tired, even if it has to work for consecutive hours. This is a 
major benefit over humans, who need a rest from time to time to be efficient. However, in the case of machines, their 
efficiency is not affected by any external factor and it does not get in the way of continuous work.</h3>

<h1>8-Right decision making</h1>
<h3>The complete absence of emotions from a machine makes it more efficient as they are able to make the right decisions in a 
short span of time. The best example of this is its usage in healthcare. The integration of AI tools in the healthcare 
sector has improved the efficiency of treatments by minimizing the risk of false diagnosis.</h3>

<h1>9-Implementing AI in risky situations</h1>
<h3>Human safety is taken care of by machines. Safety is vulnerable and with machines that are fitted with predefined 
algorithms, this can be used. Scientists use complex machines to study the ocean floor where human survival becomes 
difficult. This is the level of AI. It reaches the place where humans can’t reach. Thus, helps to solve issues in a jiffy.</h3>
